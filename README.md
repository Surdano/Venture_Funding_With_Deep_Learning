This is a program that creates and compares binary classification models using deep neural networks, which predicts whether Alphabet Soup funding appliants will be successful.

---
## Technologies

This program uses [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/) along with the following packages:

[Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install)

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

[hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) 

[sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/)

[tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

[Keras](https://keras.io/)

---
## Installation Guide
The dependencies needed to use the anaylzer are:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler,OneHotEncoder
```
---
## Usage

If you have Tensorflow installed on your local computer, launch Jupyter Lab with the file: 
```python
venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb
```
If your computer uses the Apple M1 chip and are unable to install Tensorflow on your local computer, utilize the Google Colab file:
```python
GC_venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb
```
Once the program starts running, it will take you through building deep learning models that you can compare to maximize accuracy.
